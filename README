This is a simple class called "Dabbler" that will read json data from DabbleDB

It could probably implements some SPL interfaces and be much more elegant.

It's data returned is array data, as dabbles supports column names that would 
confound a standard object

The data URL in question here is a public facing "view" of a data table in
dabble, viewed as JSON. It's fairly easy to navigate to here from the web
interface.  However, if the data is not publicly available, one would need
 to extend or modify this class or the URL in order to get the authentication 
 included.
